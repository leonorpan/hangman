# Hangman
<b>Hangman Game (Java)</b>

A client/server application for the all-time-classic Hangman game. This project was
very educational in aspects such as multi-threading and socket communication. For
the development of the game, the java.net classes were used, as well as the Swing
framework for the GUI components.
